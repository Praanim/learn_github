so basically it is 11 pm and i m starting to learn github from start

lets go !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


for the second commit i m just writing random stuff

step -3
so basically i have cloned my first random file into my vs code editor
trying to do some add,commits and push...lets see

step-4...

so  basically what i found is that there are two repositories 
one is local control repo in our machine
git add and commit in cli tracks and saves changes in local repo
not in remote...i repeat only in local

git push is the command which makes the changes in remote repo 
that is github website

step-5 
so now i am learning the concept of branching here...
so i am doing modiifications to this file 
okay done!!!
